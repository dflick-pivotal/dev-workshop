= Lab 6 - Deploying Cloud Native Architectures to Cloud Foundry

_A completed version of this lab is found at `$COURSE_HOME/labs/complete/fortune-teller-cf`._

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform for running cloud native application architectures. It operates under the tenants of the Cloud Foundry haiku:

____
Here is my code.

Run it on the cloud for me.

I do not care how.
____

Cloud Foundry does the work of analyzing your application and determining its runtime needs through a process called `cf push`, which uploads your code and launches a _buildpack_ to create a runtime package including things like a JDK. This package, called a _droplet_ is launched in a Linux container using the same underlying technology as Docker. Cloud Foundry also handles _provisioning_ of and _binding_ your application to marketplace services like databases, as well as other non-functional concerns like aggregating and providing access to application metrics and logs.

In this lab, we'll leverage _Spring Cloud Services (SCS)_, which is a Cloud Foundry marketplace version of the same services you ran on your laptop. These services are made available via _Pivotal Web Services (PWS)_, which is a SaaS version of Cloud Foundry operated by Pivotal.

== Dependency Changes

we'll make a few changes to the dependencies present in your applications. We'll be removing the Cloud Bus Kafka and Zipkin dependencies. Also, we'll leverage some SCS specific starters. They are a superset of the starters you already used for Spring Cloud OSS, and include features such as opinionated security based on Cloud Foundry service bindings.

. First, we need to alter the dependency management block of the parent pom, at `${COURSE_HOME}/labs/initial/fortune-teller/pom.xml`:
+
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.1.RELEASE</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>Finchley.RELEASE</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

. In `fortune-teller-fortune-service/pom.xml`, replace all of the dependencies matching the pattern `spring-cloud-starter-*` with these SCS dependencies:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. In `fortune-teller-ui/pom.xml`, replace all of the dependencies matching the pattern `spring-cloud-starter-*` with these SCS dependencies:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-circuit-breaker</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Build and Push!

. Using Maven, build and package the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry using the Cloud Foundry CLI, and target the space you were assigned in the class spreadsheet:
+
----
cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
API endpoint: api.run.pivotal.io

Email> dflick@pivotal.io

Password>
Authenticating...
OK

Select an org (or press enter to skip):
1. dieter-org
2. EMEA

Org> 2
Targeted org EMEA

Select a space (or press enter to skip):
There are too many options to display, please type in the name.

Space> dflick-dev
Targeted space dflick-dev



API endpoint:   https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.131.0)
User:           dflick@pivotal.io
Org:            EMEA
Space:          dflick-dev
----

. Next, we'll use a script to create instances of each of the marketplace services that we need. Take a look at `scripts/create_services.sh`:
+
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cf cs p.mysql db-small fortunes-db
echo "configure your repo !!!!!"
#cf cs p-config-server standard config-server -c '{"skipSslValidation": true, "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/fortune-teller", "searchPaths": "configuration" } }'
cf cs p-config-server standard config-server -c '{"git": { "uri": "https://github.com/dflick-pivotal/configrepo" } }'
cf cs p-service-registry standard service-registry
cf cs p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
----
+
This script is creating each of the following:
+
- A MySQL database
- A Config Server, pointing to a Git repository (if you like, point at your own fork by editing the script!)
- A Service Registry, based on Eureka
- A Circuit Breaker Dashboard, based on the Hystrix Dashboard
+
The SCS services are provisioned asynchronously, so you'll need to check on their status before continuing.

. Execute the script:
+
----
$ scripts/pws-create-services.sh
Creating service instance fortunes-db in org EMEA / space dflick-dev as dflick@pivotal.io...
OK

Creating service instance fortunes-config-server in org EMEA / space dflick-dev as dflick@pivotal.io...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service fortunes-config-server' to check operation status.

Creating service instance fortunes-service-registry in org EMEA / space dflick-dev as dflick@pivotal.io...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service fortunes-service-registry' to check operation status.

OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service fortunes-circuit-breaker-dashboard' to check operation status.
----
+
Then check the status of all services:
+
----
$ cf services
Getting services in org EMEA / space dflick-dev as dflick@pivotal.io...

name                                 service                       plan    bound apps   last operation
fortunes-circuit-breaker-dashboard   p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   trial                create succeeded
fortunes-config-server               p-config-server               trial                create succeeded
fortunes-db                          cleardb                       spark                create succeeded
fortunes-service-registry            p-service-registry            trial                create in progress
----
+
You'll want to keep executing this command (e.g. by using the UNIX command `watch`) until all of the services have the status `create succeeded`:
+
----
$ cf s
Getting services in org EMEA / space dflick-dev as dflick@pivotal.io...

name                                 service                       plan    bound apps   last operation
fortunes-circuit-breaker-dashboard   p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   trial                create succeeded
fortunes-config-server               p-config-server               trial                create succeeded
fortunes-db                          cleardb                       spark                create succeeded
fortunes-service-registry            p-service-registry            trial                create succeeded
----

. Next we'll use `cf push` to push the `fortune-teller` applications. Take a look at `fortune-teller/manifest-pcf.yml` (look for numbered annotations in the listing):
+
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service <1>
  memory: 1024M <2>
  random-route: true <3>
  path: fortune-teller-fortune-service/target/fortune-teller-fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <4>
  services: <5>
  - fortunes-db
  - config-server
  - service-registry
  #env:
    # Replace with API URI of target PCF environment
    #CF_TARGET: https://api.yourpcfenvironment.local
- name: fortune-ui
  memory: 1024M
  random-route: true
  path: fortune-teller-ui/target/fortune-teller-ui-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - config-server
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker
  #env: <6>
    # Replace with API URI of target PCF environment
    #CF_TARGET: https://api.yourpcfenvironment.local
----
<1> Gives the application a name unique to your space.
<2> Sets the maximum available memory in the Linux container allocated to your application.
<3> Give the application a hostname. The hostname must be unique to the domain you're using (in this case, `cfapps.io`), so `${random-word}` will attach a randomly generated token from a dictionary.
<4> Indicates the application artifact (in this case, your Spring Boot jar file) to be uploaded.
<5> Indicates the services that should be bound to your application.
<6> Indicates environment variables to be set in the environment of your running application process.

. Push the applications. This command will automatically pickup a `manifest.yml` file if present in the current directory (look for numbered annotations in the listing):
+
----

== Correlated Logs with Spring Cloud Sleuth

Now we're going to look at how to correlate logs across a call graph using Spring Cloud Sleuth, which automatically instruments Spring Cloud applications and adds correlation information to our logs.

To look at the latency involved in a call graph, we're interested in four events:

- *Client Send (CS):* the client sends a call to the remote service
- *Server Receive (SR):* the call is received by the remote service and work begins
- *Server Send (SS):* the server has completed work and responds to the client
- *Client Receive (CR):* the client receives the response from the remote service

Correlating these four events will help us determine how long an operation took and what the potential sources of latency are.

. Add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` of both `fortune-teller-fortune-service` and `fortune-teller-ui`:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+

. Rebuild and push both applications.

. Access the ui app via the browser. You should see the correlated log events in each applications' logs:

Pay attention to the section of the log statement that appears in square brackets immediately after the log level:
+
----
[fortunes,f786f3a50f6cfc61,f37ed227d3ffff10,false]
----
+
The tokens represent the following:
+
1. The application name (`fortunes`)
2. The trace ID (`f786f3a50f6cfc61`)
3. The span ID (`f37ed227d3ffff10`)
4. Should this trace be exported to Zipkin (`false`)
+
To learn more about this terminology, see this http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html#_features_2[section] of the Spring Cloud Sleuth documentation.

. But wait, you do not need to correlate the logs and traces on your own. PCF Metrics does the job for your
