= Lab 5 - Deploying Cloud Native Architectures to Cloud Foundry

_A completed version of this lab is found at `$COURSE_HOME/labs/complete/fortune-teller-cf`._

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform for running cloud native application architectures. It operates under the tenants of the Cloud Foundry haiku:

____
Here is my code.

Run it on the cloud for me.

I do not care how.
____

Cloud Foundry does the work of analyzing your application and determining its runtime needs through a process called `cf push`, which uploads your code and launches a _buildpack_ to create a runtime package including things like a JDK. This package, called a _droplet_ is launched in a Linux container using the same underlying technology as Docker. Cloud Foundry also handles _provisioning_ of and _binding_ your application to marketplace services like databases, as well as other non-functional concerns like aggregating and providing access to application metrics and logs.

In this lab, we'll leverage _Spring Cloud Services (SCS)_, which is a Cloud Foundry marketplace version of the same services you ran on your laptop. These services are made available via _Pivotal Web Services (PWS)_, which is a SaaS version of Cloud Foundry operated by Pivotal.

== Dependency Changes

First, we'll make a few changes to the dependencies present in your applications. We'll be removing the Cloud Bus Kafka and Zipkin dependencies, as these services are not yet available on PWS. Also, we'll leverage some SCS specific starters. They are a superset of the starters you already used for Spring Cloud OSS, and include features such as opinionated security based on Cloud Foundry service bindings.

. First we need to change our parent pom's parent, at `${COURSE_HOME}/labs/initial/fortune-teller/pom.xml`:
+
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.2.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
----

. Next, we need to alter the dependency management block of the parent pom, at `${COURSE_HOME}/labs/initial/fortune-teller/pom.xml`:
+
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
			<version>Camden.SR4</version>
			<type>pom</type>
			<scope>import</scope>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-services-dependencies</artifactId>
			<version>1.4.1.RELEASE</version>
			<type>pom</type>
			<scope>import</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

. In `fortune-teller-fortune-service/pom.xml`, replace all of the dependencies matching the pattern `spring-cloud-starter-*` with these SCS dependencies:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. In `fortune-teller-ui/pom.xml`, replace all of the dependencies matching the pattern `spring-cloud-starter-*` with these SCS dependencies:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-circuit-breaker</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Build and Push!

. Using Maven, build and package the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Login to PWS using the Cloud Foundry CLI, and target the space you were assigned in the class spreadsheet:
+
----
$ cf api api.run.pivotal.io

OK

API endpoint:   https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.63.0)

Space:          instructor
----

. Next, we'll use a script to create instances of each of the marketplace services that we need. Take a look at `scripts/create_services.sh`:
+
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cf cs p-mysql 100mb fortunes-db
cf cs p-config-server standard config-server -c '{"git": { "uri": "https://github.com/mstine/config-repo" } }'
cf cs p-service-registry standard service-registry
cf cs p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker-dashboard
----
+
This script is creating each of the following:
+
- A MySQL database
- A Config Server, pointing to a Git repository (if you like, point at your own fork by editing the script!)
- A Service Registry, based on Eureka
- A Circuit Breaker Dashboard, based on the Hystrix Dashboard
+
The SCS services are provisioned asynchronously, so you'll need to check on their status before continuing.

. Execute the script:
+
----
$ scripts/create_services.sh
Creating service instance fortunes-db in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
Creating service instance config-server in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service config-server' to check operation status.
Creating service instance service-registry in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service service-registry' to check operation status.
Creating service instance circuit-breaker-dashboard in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service circuit-breaker-dashboard' to check operation status.
----
+
Then check the status of all services:
+
----
$ cf services
Getting services in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK

name                        service                       plan       bound apps   last operation
circuit-breaker-dashboard   p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   standard                create in progress
config-server               p-config-server               standard                create in progress
fortunes-db                 p-mysql                       100mb                   create succeeded
service-registry            p-service-registry            standard                create in progress
----
+
You'll want to keep executing this command (e.g. by using the UNIX command `watch`) until all of the services have the status `create succeeded`:
+
----
$ cf s
Getting services in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK

name                        service                       plan       bound apps   last operation
circuit-breaker-dashboard   p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   standard                create succeeded
config-server               p-config-server               standard                create succeeded
fortunes-db                 p-mysql                       100mb                   create succeeded
service-registry            p-service-registry            standard                create succeeded
----

. Next we'll use `cf push` to push the `fortune-teller` applications. Take a look at `fortune-teller/manifest.yml` (look for numbered annotations in the listing):
+
----
applications:
- name: fortune-service # <1>
  memory: 1024M # <2>
  host: fortunes-${random-word} # <3>
  path: fortune-teller-fortune-service/target/fortune-teller-fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar # <4>
  services: # <5>
  - fortunes-db
  - config-server
  - service-registry
- name: fortune-ui
  memory: 1024M
  host: fortunes-ui-${random-word}
  path: fortune-teller-ui/target/fortune-teller-ui-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - config-server
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
env: # <6>
  CF_TARGET: https://api.run.pivotal.io
----
<1> Gives the application a name unique to your space.
<2> Sets the maximum available memory in the Linux container allocated to your application.
<3> Give the application a hostname. The hostname must be unique to the domain you're using (in this case, `cfapps.io`), so `${random-word}` will attach a randomly generated token from a dictionary.
<4> Indicates the application artifact (in this case, your Spring Boot jar file) to be uploaded.
<5> Indicates the services that should be bound to your application.
<6> Indicates environment variables to be set in the environment of your running application process.

. Push the applications. This command will automatically pickup a `manifest.yml` file if present in the current directory (look for numbered annotations in the listing):
+
----
$ cf push
